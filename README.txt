Program: Heap template

A driver is supplied that just needs to be compiled and run to run the template, tests all functions supplied.
Everytime it stops, enter a character and hit enter (allows it to pause at steps so you can see what is going on).


Errors:

Will sometimes crash on start.
Sort may not work correctly.
Remove Max may not work correctly (*unsure).
